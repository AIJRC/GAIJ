## Kindergardens (preschools) ##
The municipality pays states subs idies to the kindergarden companies. The kindergarden regulation (Barnehageloven) states that the money from the state should be used to manage the kindergarden.

The [law](https://lovdata.no/dokument/NL/lov/2005-06-17-64/KAPITTEL_5#KAPITTEL_5)
has a special paragraph: 
> § 23. Krav til bruk av offentlige tilskudd og foreldrebetaling i private barnehager
which states:
> The nursery shall not engage in transactions and cover costs with the owner, the owner's relatives or companies in the same group as the owner on terms or with amounts that deviate from or exceed what would have been determined between independent parties. The nursery school must not have significantly lower personnel costs per full-time place than is usual in similar municipal nurseries. The nursery school must be able to document that public grants and parental payments have been used in accordance with this section.

That’s the law. A way of avoiding this law, is a scheme where
* the kindergarden management companies pays rent to the owners of the kindergarden properties, or/and
* the kindergarden management companies pays loan interest to the ultimate company owner, f.ex. the Private Equity investment funds that have bought a large part of the kindergarden property companies.
* intra-group loans in kindergartens as a way to minimize taxable income, so Norwegian based management companies avoid pay taxes when they’re owned by a larger group or foreign company

Possible ways of how owners of private kindergartens may get extra profit are:
• loans within a business group
• rent and purchase of services within a business group
• transfers to other entities within a business group such as "konsernbidrag" (for foreign owned companies)
• contribution payments if purchased by another company.

We would like to find out:
* How much rent have the kindergarden management companies paid in a) house rent and b) loan interest the latest years?
* How much money have the large kindergarden chains received in a) house rent and b) loan interest from the management companies?
* How much money have the property owners received from the management companies.

We have in this email an exel sheet with 3 columns:
* column A is the unique organization number to all the kindergardens in Norway
* column b is the unique organization number to alle the large kindergarden chain companies in Norway
* column C is the unique organization number to all property's owner that kindergartens are renting from. Zeros in the data means that a kindergarten does not rent.

Could we do a key word search for the annual reports with this specific organization numbers to try to answer this questions?

What are the other words close to the keyword? What are the amount of money mentioned close to the keyword?
Keywords for these searches in the annual reports would be in both Norwegian and English, because some companies use English in the annual reports.
