2. **Extraction Rules:**
   - Do not fabricate information. Base your analysis strictly on evidence from the document and not in the provided examples. Do not infer or assume information.
   - If no evidence is found for a specific aspect, set the flag to `False` and leave the details field empty.
   - If an issue is identified set the flag to 'True' on the appropriate field and provide a concise summary of the evidence, including amounts, concepts, and involved parties.
   - After extraction if the flag is set to true, check if there is a possibility the data you extracted is incorrect or fabricated. Be very strict, if the answer is yes, set the flag to false and the details to 'null'.

3. **Output Format:**
   - Provide the extracted information in the following JSON structure:
